######################## Installing Composer Walkthrough  - UNIX         ########################

--Local Install--
Installing Composer locally is a matter of just running the installer in your project directory:

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Note: If the above fails for some reason, you can download the installer with php instead:
php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php

The installer will just check a few PHP settings and then download composer.phar to your working 
directory. This file is the Composer binary. It is a PHAR (PHP archive), which is an archive 
format for PHP which can be run on the command line, amongst other things.

Now just run php composer.phar in order to run Composer.

Using the Installer#

This is the easiest way to get Composer set up on your machine.

Download and run Composer-Setup.exe. It will install the latest Composer version and set up your
PATH so that you can just call composer from any directory in your command line.

Note: Close your current terminal. Test usage with a new terminal: This is important since the
PATH only gets loaded when the terminal starts.
